# Jira-Automation
GitHub-Jira Integration via Webhooks.

Developed and deployed an automated system to streamline issue tracking by integrating GitHub with Jira. I designed a Python application, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, to handle GitHub webhook events and interact with Jiraâ€™s API. When a developer comments `/jira` on a GitHub issue, the system automatically creates a corresponding Jira ticket. I configured Jira, set up API tokens, and implemented Flask-based web services to process GitHub issue details and trigger ticket creation in Jira. This automation significantly reduced manual workload and improved the efficiency of issue management across platforms. Technologies used include Python, Flask, GitHub API, Jira API, AWS EC2, Webhooks, and REST APIs.
